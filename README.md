This project is a Drupal 8 site for the purpose of demoing [Probo CI](http://probo.ci). It contains Drupal 8.0.3, a 'tests' directory with some basic Behat tests, and a .probo.yaml file for the Probo build configuration.

Want to try out Probo? Fork this repository, enable it in the [Probo app](https://app.probo.ci) and make a new pull request.
